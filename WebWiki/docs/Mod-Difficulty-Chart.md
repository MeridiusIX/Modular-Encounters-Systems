This page explains the difficulty rating system that some NPC encounter mods utilizing MES may include in their mod-page descriptions.

|Rating|Title&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|Description|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|★☆☆☆☆|No Challenge|Encounters Are Not Hostile|
|★★☆☆☆|Minimal|Encounters are passively hostile, will only use turrets if you get close|
|★★★☆☆|Average|Encounters will likely not engage players unless provoked or approached|
|★★★★☆|Hostile|Encounters will seek players and attack when conditions are met (visibility, signals, etc)|
|★★★★★|Nightmare|Encounters are aware of all targets in the area and will relentlessly attack|
