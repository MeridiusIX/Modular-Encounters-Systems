# Welcome to the Modular Encounters Systems Wiki!

This mod is a combination of the Modular Encounters Spawner and RivalAI frameworks. In this wiki you will find resources for several topics relating to configuring the mod settings, resources for building your own mods using this framework, and troubleshooting resources.

If you are having issues with the mod framework, or any of the mods that utilize it, I suggest you start with the **Player Support** section of this wiki (see side menu on the right). This section answers several common questions and also provides troubleshooting steps for many of the more common issues people may encounter.

Here is what to expect in each section:  

 - **Player Support:** This section contain common troubleshooting and FAQs that some players may need if they run into issues with the mod.  

 - **Admin & Configuration:** This section contains information on all the various configuration options for MES, where to find them, and also how to activate them.  

 - **Modding:** This section has information on all the various tags and profiles that are used in mods that utilize MES.  

 - **Template / Example Files:** These are file templates you can use to start building your own mod.  

 - **Modder Resources:** This section contains pre-made profiles, scripting API, and other tips / tricks for developing your own MES enabled mod.  

 - **Mod Repositories:** This section links to various other NPC mods Github repositories that I've published. You can study these to learn how various profiles and tags come together to make a functional MES enabled mod.
